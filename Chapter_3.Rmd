## Variables and Data

### Definition

- **Variable**: A characteristic that varies from one person or thing to another. For example, height, eye color.
- **Quantitative variables**: Numerical variables. Height is a quantitative variable.
- **Qualitative variables**: non-numerical variables, also called categorical variables. Eye color is a quanlitative variable.
- **Discrete variable**: a quantitative variable whose possible values can be listed. For example, number of siblings.
- **Continuous variable**: a quantitative variable whose possible values form some interval of numbers. For example, height of a person.

### Definition

- **Data**: Values of a variable
- **Qualitative data**: Values of a qualitative variable
- **Quantitative data**: Values of a quantitative variable.
- **Discrete data**: Values of a discrete variable.
- **Continuous data**: Values of a continuous variable.

### Example

Human blood types: A, B, AB, O. What kind of data do you receive when you are told your blood type?

**Solution**: Blood type is a qualitative variable. Therefore your blood type is qualitative data.

### Example

The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on household size and publishes the information in Current Population Reports. What kind of data is the number of people in your household?

**Solution**: Household size is a quantitative variable, which is also a discrete variable because its possible values are 1, 2, ...

## Organizing Qualitative Data

### Definition: Frequency Distribution of Qualitative Data

**A frequency distribution** of qualitative data is a listing of the distinct values and their frequencies.

### Example

A class of students have the political party affiliation below. Order them and construct a frequency table.

```{r}
x = c("Democratic", "Democratic","Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Democratic", 
      "Democratic","Democratic","Democratic", "Democratic","Democratic","Democratic",
      "Democratic","Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Democratic","Democratic",
      "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", 
      "Republic", "Republic", "Democratic", "Republic", "Republic",  "Republic", 
      "Democratic","Democratic", "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", "Republic", 
     "Republic", "Republic", "Other", "Other", "Other", "Other", "Other")
```
Order the values:

```{r}
sort(x)
```

Count frequency:

```{r}
table(x)

```
### Relative Frequency

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Number of Observations}}
$$
```{r}
freq = table(x)
Relative_frequency = freq  / sum(freq)

Relative_frequency

```
Sum of relative frequencies equals 1.


### Pie chart

Construct a pie chart for political party affiliations. Use R function `pie()`. Either frequency or relative frequency can be used for drawing pie chart.

```{r}
pie(Relative_frequency)
```

Same pie chart here:
```{r}
pie(freq)
```
All possible party affiliations in a pie chart must add up to 100\%.

### Bar charts

Bar chart of frequency:
```{r}
barplot(freq, col = c("blue", "green", "red"), ylab="Frequency")
```

Bar chart of frequency:
```{r}
barplot(Relative_frequency, col = c("blue", "green", "red"), ylab="Relative Frequency")
```

## Organizing Quantitative Data

### Single-value Grouping

Example. Number of TVs in each of 50 randomly selected households. Group the data by single values.

```{r}
x = c(1,1,1,2,3,5,2,0,4,5,
      3,2,3,2,3,2,2,1,1,1,
      4,4,3,3,4,2,2,2,1,1,
      6,4,3,2,2,3,4,5,3,2,
      4,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1)

#single-value grouping
table(x)
```


### Limit Grouping

Multiple classes are created and each class consists of a range of values. Suppose we create categories 0-1, 2, 3, 4-6, then we can summarize as

- **0-1**: 12
- **2**: 15
- **3**: 12
- **4-6**: 11

### Cutpoint Grouping

- **<=2**: 27
- **>2**: 23

### Histogram

Histogram is to display the distribution of a sample with relative chance of occurrence. A peak point indicates a value the occurs the most frequently. It is often superimposed with a probability density curve, which indicates the same meaning.

```{r}
      ########################
    	#Histgram
    	########################
    	x = rnorm(100)
    	hist(x) 
    	
    hist(x, col = 5, main="Default Histogram")
		hist(x, col = 5, density = 20, main = "Density = 20")
		hist(x, freq=FALSE, col = 6, main="Relative Frequency")
		hist(x, freq=FALSE, col = "pink", main = "Curve Overlay")
		lines(density(x), col = "blue", lwd = 3)
```

A histogram displays the classes of the quantitative data on a horizontal axis and the frequencies (relative frequencies, percents) of those classes on a vertical axis. The frequency (relative frequency, percent) of each class is represented by a vertical bar whose height is equal to the frequency (relative frequency, percent) of that class. The bars should be positioned so that they touch each other.

To construct a histogram:

- **Step 1** Obtain a frequency (relative-frequency, percent) distribution of the data.

- **Step 2** Draw a horizontal axis on which to place the bars and a vertical axis on which to display the frequencies (relative frequencies, percents).

- **Step 3** For each class, construct a vertical bar whose height equals the frequency (relative frequency, percent) of that class.

- **Step 4** Label the bars with the classes, as explained in Definition 2.9, the horizontal axis with the name of the variable, and the vertical axis with “Frequency” (“Relative frequency,” “Percent”).

```{r}
hist(x, xlab="Number of TVs at Household", main="Histogram of Number of TVs at Household", col="maroon")
```
```{r}
hist(x, xlab="Number of TVs at Household", main="Histogram of Number of TVs at Household", freq=FALSE, ylab="Relative Frequency", col="turquoise")
```

### Dotplots

A dotplot is a graph in which each observation is plotted as a dot at an appropriate place above a horizontal axis. Observations having equal values are stacked vertically.

- **Step 1** Draw a horizontal axis that displays the possible values of the quantitative data.
- **Step 2** Record each observation by placing a dot over the appropriate value on the horizontal axis.
- **Step 3** Label the horizontal axis with the name of the variable.


```{r}
dotchart(x, col="turquoise", xlab="Number of TVs at Household", 
         main="Dot Chart of Number of TVs at Household",)
```

### Stem-leaf diagrams

In a stem-and-leaf diagram (or stemplot), each observation Is separated into two parts, namely, a stem-consisting of all but the rightmost digit- and a leaf, the rightmost digit. 

To Construct a stem-and-leaf diagram 

- **Step 1** Think of each observation as a stem-consisting of all but the rightmost digit-and a leaf, the rightmost digit.
- **Step 2** Write the stems from smallest to largest in a vertical column to the left of a vertical rule.
- **Step 3** Write each leaf to the right of the vertical rule in the row that contains the appropriate stem.
- **Step 4** Arrange the leaves in each row in  ascending order.

```{r}
x = c(54, 43, 67, 76, 45, 59, 66, 66, 68, 78, 80, 92)

stem(x)
```
